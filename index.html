                <p>
                    In response to the COVID-19 crisis, laboratories around the world have ceased in-person human data
                    collection. In principle, many of these laboratories could run their studies online. With over
                    4,000,000,000 people online, most populations of interest are reachable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This workshop serves to help laboratories get their research online, covering the key
                    technologies necessary as well as best practices when designing for research on the Web. We will
                    work with the <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/" target="_blank">jsPsych</a> and <a

                    Following up on Session 1, we will dive deeper into harnessing the features of jsPsych to be able to
                    create more complicated study design features necessary for most research studies; this includes
                    dynamically-generated stimuli, performance based branching, and complex condition randomization and
                    sampling. Core topics will include:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Functions as parameters (e.g. practice trials show correct/incorrect stimulus based on previous
                        response)</li>
                    <li>Timeline variables: randomizing and sampling (e.g. repeating the same type of trial with
                        differentsets of stimuli)</li>
                    <li>Conditional and looping behavior (e.g. practice trials repeat if accuracy is below threshold)
                    </li>
                    <li>Working with jsPsych data (e.g. showing a performance summary at the end of the task)</li>
                    <li>A tour of plugin code and how to modify plugins</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Providing participation incentives, such as results shareable on social media or game-like
                        features such as earning badges for participation (for users who create an account on the
                        website)</li>

                    <li>Supporting mobile, tablet, and desktop devices</li>
                    <li>Enabling user accounts for longitudinal studies and boosting participant return rates (e.g. for
                        collecting data for a single participant on multiple studies, with the potential to
                        cross-analyze results within subjects)</li>
                    <li>Supporting a forum, where participants may discuss questions and provide feedback on various
